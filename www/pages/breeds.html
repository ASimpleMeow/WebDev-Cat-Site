  <h2><u>TOP 5 CAT BREEDS</u></h2>

      <div class="column middle aligned">
        <h3>1. The Persian</h3>
        <p>The Persian Cat has been the most popular cat since 1871 since records have started being 
        kept. This particular breed is typically very loyal and affectionate, however due to it's long
        fur it requires more grooming than a regular cat.

      <div class="column middle aligned">
        <h3>2. The Maine Coon</h3>
        <p>Since 1992 this breed of cat held it's second place in popularity. It's considered to be very
        gentle and loving breed. It's also a very big cat, they weigh between 15 and 25 pounds and have
        long fur similar to the Persian. However they don't need as much grooming as the Persian.

      <div class="column middle aligned">
        <h3>3. The Exotic</h3>
        <p>The Exotic's are very similar in apperance to the Persian cat but with shorter fur (I'm noticing that
        the top places hold cat that look like the Persian). They are very nice, like the Persian but require far less
        grooming than the Persians. They are also generally smaller in size than the Persian.

        <h3>4. The Siamese</h3>
        <p>Now this is a very pretty breed, they are very vocal and like to "chat" with their owners. They have a very
        sleek physique and are very athletic. They usually gravitate to only one person and are quite loyal and loyal
        to that person.

        <h3>5. The Abyssinian</h3>
        <p>This breed of cat is very elegent. They are thin and elegant with a shiny coat, they are active felines, 
        very playful and friendly. They also remind me of the Khjait race in Skyrim! I mean really look, they 
        look almost identical!
